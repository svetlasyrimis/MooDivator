# Moodifier
## GA Project 1

**_MooDivator_** is a web app that generates a random CrossFit workout for the user and helps him/her to get through the intense Crossfit workout by displaying random motivational quotes using FavQs API. **_Moodifier_**'s main goal is to deliver unique user experience by generating  random empowering quotes that should encourage maximum physical performance.

## Features: 
1. **Dropdown Select menu** to choose a type of workout.
2. **GO button** to generate a truly random workout from the selected type.
3. **Timer**(with milliseconds) to keep track of the time while user is doing the workout.
4. **Quotes** appearing on the screen once the timer is started on a set interval of 1min or less.

## Technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX

## Stretch goals: 
1. Feature to save completed workouts to user's browser.
2. Adding a second API to generate images along with the quotes.

## Unsolved problems:
I wanted to include a fade-in-out anmation on each quote but unfortunately couldn't figure out how to do this, I only managed to do it for the first quote that appears on the screen.
